Today is the first day of a series of 30 mini crosswords designed to help you become a better crossword solver. They're free for all players, and you can solve the first one [here](https://www.puzzmo.com).

In college, I accidentally majored in German by walking into the wrong classroom. It was the week before my freshman year of class was about to start, and the departments were having open houses for the new students. All of this was printed out in the big course listings book, and a typo led me unwittingly to the German open house, which was unattended except for me and three professors. We got into an hourlong conversation, I enrolled in German 101, and the rest is history: by the time I graudated, German was the only department in which I took a class every single semester, and I graduated with a major.

At the time, the German department at my university was top-ranked in the U.S. English was not to be spoken in class, not even on the first day of the 101 course. The professor in charge of the introductory language classes was Dr. R, and I came to learn that she had been extremely strict with the teachers she supervised: I learned that she had them write every lecture, word for word, in order for her to verify that when they were lecturing us in German, they never used vocabulary or grammar that we hadn't yet covered in class.

I think a lot about language learning when I'm constructing and editing crosswords. I often, for example, look up all the possible translations in language learning dictionaries for clue inspiration. I have also [written](https://link.mailer.puzzmo.com/view/652eb296b069b512940514d1ltjzm.ku4/63373e23) about language learning as a metaphor for learning to solve crosswords. The *vocabulary* of a crossword is its content, and the *grammar* of a crossword are the rules and conventions it follows. In language learning, both vocabulary and grammar are crucial, and learning is most effective when they progress together.

In [my introduction](https://youtu.be/fBXTcrxrR64?feature=shared) for this year's [Crossword Con](https://www.crosswordcon.com/), I said the following:

*No crossword puzzle is neutral. Every crossword has a take on what words are real, what facts are true, and what is reasonable to expect solvers to know. It is my view that crossword programs marquerade as arbiters of intellect: by portraying a biased subset of culture as general knowledge — or not correcting you when you mistake it for general knowledge and perhaps as a consequence decide that crosswords are not for you, because you did not know the regional, or upper class, or whitewashed, or cis-normative or ableist content.*

For most of my crossword career I've been concerned with crossword vocabularly: from the editors who dictate the content of a crossword venue, to the constructors whose experiences inform the content they include, to the solvers who may feel validated or alienated by that content. As of today, you have more than 700 Puzzmo Cross|words that establish our vocabulary. For October, I'm excited to turn for a moment to the grammar.

Long before I joined Puzzmo, Zach knew that if Puzzmo were going to run a crossword puzzle, it had to be more approachable than any crossword he'd seen. To this end, he developed our hint system, the word boundaries, and other assists, which you can listen to him [talk about](https://youtu.be/ScUJaXrAc7k?feature=shared&t=83) at the inaugural [Crossword Con](https://www.crosswordcon.com/2024).

We have never run a mini on [Puzzmo.com](https://www.puzzmo.com) because Zach has always been skeptical about minis being helpful for learning to solve bigger crosswords. For the past two years, I've turned Zach's critique over and over in my head. It feels true: many of my friends solve a mini crossword every day, but don't enjoy or can't complete a larger crossword. Mini crosswords cannot really have themes; there is no real grid "navigation", there is never a difficult corner that has to be "broken into."

About six months ago, in a conversation with Orta, I broke through. The thing that unites mini crosswords and larger crosswords are the *clues*. Despite a mini's extremely limited geometry, it must use the same rules and conventions for its clues as any other crossword.  Minis can certainy be entertaining as their own variation of the game of crosswords. But if minis are to be *useful*, it will be because they are tools for — in the context of my language learning metaphor — teaching crossword *grammar*.

From October 1 to October 30, we'll be running a free crossword "course" on Puzzmo: 30 mini crosswords, each designed to teach you a rule or convention about crossword solving. We're repurposing Puzzmo's [hint architecture](https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2024/07/22/hints-v2/) as a tutorial tool, and every mini's post-solve notes will lead off with a discussion of the lesson it contains. Just like my former German professor, I won't use any techniques before they're explicitly introduced in a lesson.

I always thought it was funny ([komisch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/komisch#German) — the weird/strange version of funny, not [lustig](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lustig#German) — the enjoyable/pleasing version of funny) that I walked into the wrong classroom one day freshman year and it determined such a huge swath of my life. But the operative moment wasn't nessarily that I arrived, but that I stayed.

If you haven't tried crosswords before, why don't you try our 101 course? If you like it, I hope you stay.
