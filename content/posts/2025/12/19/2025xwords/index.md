I started thinking critically about midi crosswords as a genre when [Chris](https://www.puzzmo.com/user/xwc/piuma), [Enrique](https://www.puzzmo.com/user/xwc/enrique), and I co-founded the midi branch of [AVCX](https://avxwords.com/), where we decided to define midis not by their rows and columns, but by the number of white squares in the grid. The midis we constructed and edited in the first year of our AVCX tenures were so creative in their play with shapes and sizes: even featuring answers longer than the 15-letter cap on a standard/"full-sized" newspaper crossword.

Around the same time, I was commissioned to write a book of fifty-six 10x10 midi crosswords, which got me thinking about how two related answers could constitute a theme: a joke and a punch line, or a set so "tight" that it couldn't have a third member. I now consider these the proto "apt pairs" — a name I gave to a concept that [existed](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/21/2009) long before I solved a crossword.

Before 2026, we'll have run more than 800 "midi" crosswords on [puzzmo.com](https://www.puzzmo.com), representing the work of about 200 different crossword creators. Even if my name isn't on the byline, I've been involved in each of these puzzles, and I'm still learning about new things midis can do and be. I think the Puzzmo midi is a special place for crosswords to live, and I want to celebrate it by highlighting some of my favorite midis of the year in this blog post.

A few notes before the celebration:
- I didn't include any puzzles I'd co-authored
- Each author can only appear once
- Puzzles within a category are listed in order of appearance
- I've made all the puzzles below free to solve, even if you don't have a Puzzmo Plus subscription (although now is a good time to [get one](https://www.puzzmo.com/subscribe)!)

## 10 amazing apt pairs of 2025

To me, an amazing apt pair is a delightful connection between two phrases that makes you wonder how you never saw (or heard) it yourself — and a perfect title to unite the conection.

## 10 amazing non-apt pair themes of 2025
