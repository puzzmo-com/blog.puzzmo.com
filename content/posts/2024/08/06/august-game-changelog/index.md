_Hi, Saman here! This is the first of what I hope will be many monthly changelog posts. Note that our team relies on a continuous release process, so while these changelogs will only come once the month, the changes themselves will roll out as they're completed. The changelogs are therefore always a summary of changes that are already live._

Here's what changed in our games over the last month.

### Crossword

- __Removed the hint time penalty and instead use a timer system instead__ (Read [Hints v2: Moving from a time penalty to a cooldown period](https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2024/07/22/hints-v2/) for more details).
- Adjusted the layout of the clue lists depending on the dimensions of the crossword puzzle, so wider puzzles use the stacked column clue layout more readily than narrower puzzles.

### Flipart

- Increased the size of the game on smaller screens.

### Pile-up Poker

- __Add keyboard support__.
- Added a ⭐️ indicator next to quality hand labels on the grid.
- Removed a small gap between the card slot drop areas to prevent players from accidentally dropping cards between two slots.
- Uses a lighter key color for hearts cards.
- Fixed a bug that caused performance regressions while dragging cards. This was especially noticeable on low end phones.
- Fixed a bug so cards will be more accurately centered on player's cursor while being dragged.
- Fixed a bug that prevented players from being able to rearrange cards in the draw pile.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the game to crash while moving cards with arrow keys.

### Really Bad Chess

- Increased the size of the game on smaller screens.

### Typeshift

- Added divider bars between columns.
- Increased the size of the game on smaller screens.
- Added a "missed core words" deed that can be used in custom leaderboards with the id `core-words-missed`.
